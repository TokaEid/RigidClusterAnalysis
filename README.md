# RigidClusterAnalysis
These files were my first python project. It was before I had had any python training or experience and I basically learned as I went. Humorously, these codes are quite inefficient and clearly show how weak my Python skills were. I endeavor to return to this project later and rewrite these codes in a much more efficient manner to highlight how I've grown as a programmer over the years.  


The files that were used for these codes were simulation data produced by a colleague's simulation code for visualizing the stresses on particles during shear thickening of suspensions. After producing a large dataset for various different simulations, we applied a pebble game algorithm (written by another colleague) to extract information from the simulation results and obtain the position of the particles and how rigid the bonds between them were. This enabled us to retrieve important information on the rigid clusters formed within the suspension. My codes were then written to take in the output of the pebble game algorithm and analyze the rigid cluster information to detect patterns and try to extract important information about the nature of shear thickening simulations in 2D suspensions.
